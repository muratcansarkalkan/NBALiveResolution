# NBA LIVE 2005-08 Resolution & Widescreen Update

This plugin allows user to play with widescreen resolutions in NBA Live 2005-08 without any external application.

## Installation

- Download the NO-CD fixed executable for the game you would prefer windowed mode. You need the NO-CD fixed executable as the plugin is designed for a certain version of an executable. NO-CD is also advised as original CD's of NBA Live 2005-08 series unfortunately do not run in Windows 10 and further.

- Download [ASI Loader](https://forums.nba-live.com/downloads.php?view=detail&df_id=13583) and follow instructions in Installation section at its Readme file.

- Make sure you have the latest release from Releases.

- Copy "d3d9.dll", "oledlg.dll" and "plugins" folders from the archive to your game's root folder.
Otherwise, this plugin will not work.

- Copy "plugins", "assets" and "movies" folders and "main.ini" file to your game's root folder.

- If you have NBALiveResolution_d.asi in "plugins" folder, remove the file, so that the new plugin can work properly.

- New version of plugin introduces "main.ini" where both windowed mode and menu resolution can be operated from same file. If you installed Windowed Mode plugin before, please re-download latest version.

- Open "main.ini" and you can set RES_X and RES_Y values (width and height) to an integer you want. For example, if you want to play the game in full-screen and 1920x1080 resolution, changed WINDOWED value from 1 to 0, change RES_X value from 1366 to 1920 and RES_Y value from 768 to 1080.

- To enable videos, change INTRO value under BOOTUP to 1. To disable, change to 0.

## Usage

- By default, NBA Live 2005, 06 and 07 has a total of 10 resolutions available. NBA Live 08 has 16 resolutions available. v1.0 of the plugin replaces only these resolutions. Here is the reference table for resolutions.

- To change resolutions at start and menus, you can modify RES_X and RES_Y values.

- For NBA Live 07 and 08, if there aren't any resolutions specified in wndmode.ini, default resolutions are 800x600x32.

- To play with the resolution you prefer, you need to navigate to Options -> Detail Settings and select resolution from left. For example, if you prefer a resolution of 1920x1080x32 in NBA Live 06, select 1600x1200x16 as your resolution.

- There is no extra hex edit needed, as aspect ratio is adjusted accordingly with width and height, rather than a fixed ratio.

- For NBA Live 2005 and 06, there are two sizes of intros that can be created so the plugin can properly resize the videos, until I update the function properly. If you want to create videos 4:3 aspect ratio, you need to create it with a size of 640x480. If you want to create with 16:9 instead, you need to create it with a size of 1920x1088.

- For NBA Live 07 and 08, there are no restrictions of creating video files, as game fits the video to the screen by default.
