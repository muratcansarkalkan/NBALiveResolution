- To play with the resolution you prefer, you need to navigate to Options -> Detail Settings and select resolution from left. For example, if you prefer a resolution of 1920x1080x32 in NBA Live 06, select 1600x1200x16 as your resolution.

- There is no extra hex edit needed, as aspect ratio is adjusted accordingly with width and height, rather than a fixed ratio.
